# Library-Management-System

**Objective:**
Develop a simple Library Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java.

**Tools Used:**
Java (JDK 8 or above)
VS Code / any Java IDE
Terminal / Command Prompt

**Deliverables:**
A multi-class Java project using OOP concepts.
Project Structure

**This mini-project includes the following Java classes:**
Book.java – Represents a book in the library.
User.java – Represents a library user.
Library.java – Manages the collection of books and users.
Main.java – Entry point to interact with the system.

**OOP Concepts Applied**
Encapsulation: Keeping data (e.g., book details) safe in classes with private access modifiers and public getters/setters.
Abstraction: Only exposing necessary operations like issue and return books.
Inheritance & Polymorphism: Can be expanded further (e.g., differentiating between students and faculty users).

**Features Implemented**
Add books to the library.
Register new users.
Issue a book to a user (if available).
Return a book.
Display available books and issued books.

**Sample Output Format**
